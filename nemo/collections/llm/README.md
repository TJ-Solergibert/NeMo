NeMo LLM Collection
===================

The NeMo LLM Collection is the first collection that features NeMo 2.0, a redesign of NeMo that
aims to improve the user experience in by taking a more PyTorch Lightning-like approach to make
NeMo both simpler and more modular. 

The following models are currently reimplemented in 2.0 as part of this collection:
- **GPT**
- **LLaMA**
- **Mixtral**

For detailed tutorials and documentation on NeMo 2.0, refer to the [docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo_2.0/index.html) (TODO: update this hyperlink).
